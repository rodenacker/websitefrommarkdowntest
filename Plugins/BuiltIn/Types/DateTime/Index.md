DateTime
===========

Drag a datetime type onto the canvas and assign a datetime value to it to use it as a variable. Use the SetValue to change the value further below in your process.

A datetime type can be populated with a datetime object. The default value of Date is 0:00:00 (midnight) on January 1.


It holds IEEE 64-bit (8-byte) values that represent dates ranging from
January 1 of the year 0001 through December 31 of the year 9999, and
times from 12:00:00 AM (midnight) through 11:59:59.9999999 PM. Each
increment represents 100 nanoseconds of elapsed time since the beginning
of January 1 of the year 1 in the Gregorian calendar. The maximum value
represents 100 nanoseconds before the beginning of January 1 of the year
