Boolean
=======

Drag a boolean type onto the canvas and assign a boolean value to it to use it as a variable. Use the SetValue to change the value further below in your process.

A boolean type can be set to 'TRUE' or 'FALSE'. The default value of Boolean is False.

A Linx boolean type can only be populated with True or False. It does not accept Y/N, Yes/No, 1/0, on/off.
