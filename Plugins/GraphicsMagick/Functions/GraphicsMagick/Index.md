GraphicsMagick
==============

The GraphicsMagick function provides an interface to the [GraphicsMagick
library](#GMLibrary) which allows for converting, manipulating and
reading image files.

Properties
----------

-  #### Operation

    The operation to perform.

    1.  [Compare](#Compare)  
        Analyzes the difference between two images.
    2.  [Composite](#Composite)  
        Creates a composite image by superimposing two input images.
    3.  [Convert](#Convert)  
        Converts images to a different format.
    4.  [Identify](#Identify)  
        Reads image metadata.
    5.  [Montage](#Montage)

    6.  [Transform](#Transform)  
        Modifies an existing image by applying one or more transform
        operations.

### Compare{#Compare}

The compare operation reports the difference between two images and
generates an output image highlighting the differences between the two.
For details of the values returned from this function, see [compare
operation output](#CompareOutput).

-  #### Reference image

    Path to the reference image which is used as a basis for the
    comparison.

-  #### Comparison image

    Path to the image to be compared against the reference image.

-  #### Comparison metric{#ErrorMetric}

    The function used to quantify the difference between the two images:

    1.  Mean absolute error
    2.  Mean square error
    3.  Peak absolute error
    4.  Peak signal-to-noise ratio
    5.  Root mean square error
<p>
-  #### Save annotated image

    When checked, a new image will be created, highlighting the
    differences between the reference and comparison images.

-  #### Highlight style

    The method used to highlight differences in the annotated image.

    1.  Assign  
        Assign the highlight colour to each differing pixel.
    2.  Threshold  
        Creates a black and white image, indicating the different areas.
    3.  Tint  
        Apply a tint to the different areas based on the highlight
        colour.

        XOR operation.
<p>
-  #### Highlight colour

    The colour used to highlight differences in the annotated image.

-  #### Output file

    Path to save the annotated image to.

### Composite{#Composite}

Creates a composite image by superimposing two input images.

-  #### Base image path

    Path to the base image.

-  #### Overlay image

    Path to the image to overlay on top of the base image.

-  #### Merge operation

    The merge operation to apply when compositing the two images.

    1.  Over  
         The output will be the union of the two image shapes, with
        opaque areas of overlay-image obscuring base-image in the region
        of overlap.
    2.  In  
         The output is simply overlay-image cut by the shape of
        base-image. None of the image data of base-image will be in the
        output.
    3.  Out  
         The output image is overlay-image with the shape of base-image
        cut out.
    4.  Atop  
         The output is the same shape as base-image, with overlay-image
        obscuring base-image where the image shapes overlap. Note this
        differs from over because the portion of overlay-image outside
        base-image's shape does not appear in the output.
    5.  Xor  
         The output is the image data from both overlay-image and
        base-image that is outside the overlap region. The overlap
        region will be blank.
    6.  Plus  
         The output is just the sum of the image data. Output values are
        cropped to MaxRGB (no overflow). This operation is independent
        of the matte channels.
    7.  Minus  
         The result of overlay-image - base-image, with underflow
        cropped to zero. The matte channel is ignored (set to opaque,
        full coverage).
    8.  Add  
         The result of overlay-image + base-image, with overflow
        wrapping around (mod MaxRGB+1).
    9.  Subtract  
         The result of overlay-image - base-image, with underflow
        wrapping around (mod MaxRGB+1). The add and subtract operators
        can be used to perform reversible transformations.
    10. Difference  
         The result of abs(overlay-image - base-image). This is useful
        for comparing two very similar images.
    11. Divide  
         The result of overlay-image / base-image. This is useful for
        improving the readability of text on unevenly illuminated photos
        (by using a gaussian blurred copy of overlay-image as
        base-image).
    12. Multiply  
         The result of overlay-image \* base-image. This is useful for
        the creation of drop-shadows.
    13. Bumpmap  
         The base-image shaded by overlay-image.
    14. Copy  
         The output image is base-image replaced with overlay-image.
        Here the matte information is ignored.
    15. Copy Red  
         The output image is the red channel in base-image replaced with
        the red channel in overlay-image. The other channels are copied
        untouched.
    16. Copy Green  
         The output image is the green channel in base-image replaced
        with the green channel in overlay-image. The other channels are
        copied untouched.
    17. Copy Blue  
         The output image is the blue channel in base-image replaced
        with the blue channel in overlay-image. The other channels are
        copied untouched.
    18. Copy Opacity  
         output image is the opacity channel in base-image replaced with
        the opacity channel in overlay-image. The other channels are
        copied untouched.
    19. Copy Cyan  
         The output image is the cyan channel in base-image replaced
        with the cyan channel in overlay-image. The other channels are
        copied untouched. Use of this operator requires that base-image
        be in CMYK(A) colorspace.
    20. Copy Magenta  
         output image is the magenta channel in base-image replaced with
        the magenta channel in overlay-image. The other channels are
        copied untouched. Use of this operator requires that base-image
        be in CMYK(A) colorspace.
    21. Copy Yellow  
         The output image is the yellow channel in base-image replaced
        with the yellow channel in overlay-image. The other channels are
        copied untouched. Use of this operator requires that base-image
        be in CMYK(A) colorspace.
    22. Copy Black  
         The output image is the black channel in base-image replaced
        with the black channel in overlay-image. The other channels are
        copied untouched. Use of this operator requires that base-image
        be in CMYK(A) colorspace. If overlay-image is not in CMYK space,
        then the overlay-image pixel intensities are used.
